# Eagles 1st Quarter Analysis
Improving Eagle's Offense Execution in 1st Quarter Gameplay

  Transforming	data	into	useful	information	is vital	for	a	NFL	team’s ability	to	implement	
strategies	and	make	key	football	related	decisions.	This is	why with	much	research	and	analysis
I	have	put	together	this	case	study	to	address	areas	of	improvement in the	execution	of	the	
Philadelphia	Eagles’ offense.	
  The	Eagles’ offense	struggled	mightily	within	the	first	quarter	of	regular	season	games	
during the	2016	season.	The	goal	of	this	case	study is	to	address	those	issues	by analyzing last	
season’s play	by	play	data	and find	solutions	to	the	shortcomings	that	occurred during	the	
beginning	of	games last	season.	I	will	reveal	how	play	selection	has	had	a	strong	impact	on	the	
team’s ability	to	score	touchdowns	throughout	the	sequence of	a	game, and	how	it	is	
applicable	to	finding	solutions	that	will	put	Carson	Wentz and	the	Eagles’ offense in	the	best
situation	to	have	a	more	efficient	1st quarter	of game	performance.
